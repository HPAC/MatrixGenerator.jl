# MatrixGenerator.jl
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcopik/MatrixGenerator.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mcopik/MatrixGenerator.jl)

Julia package supporting benchmarking of functions with automatic export of measurement data to a CSV file and generation of matrices with desired shapes and properties.

Supported matrix shapes: full, symmetric, upper/lower triangular (non-square as well), diagonal, banded (partial support)

Support matrix properties: random, constant, symmetric positive-definite, orthogonal
